# virtualserver
build.md - lists all commands to build the environment for VirtualServer

clean-up.md - removes everything

The basic setup is based on NGINX OSS. If you would like to demonstrate NAP:
- apply for a test license at: https://www.nginx.com/free-trial-request
- build a private repo like this one: (https://github.com/dfs5/F5CIS/tree/master/PrivateRegistry#how-to-setup-private-registry-for-a-kubernetes-cluster)
- and follow the guidance under B_add-NAP.md (https://github.com/dfs5/F5CIS/blob/master/virtualserver/2_nginx_controller/B_add-NAP.md#the-following-requires-a-private-repositotry-like-in-this-case-registrydfslablocal5000) after the OSS based deployment has been done!
